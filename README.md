# Few-Shot Object Detection for Aerial Images

A complete implementation of Few-Shot Object Detection on the NWPU VHR-10 aerial imagery dataset with comprehensive evaluation and performance analysis.

## Overview

This project implements a two-stage Few-Shot Object Detection approach for aerial imagery with significant improvements through iterative development:

### Initial Approach
1. Train a base Faster R-CNN model on 7 base classes from NWPU VHR-10
2. Use DINOv2 features with prototype learning for 3 novel classes
3. Apply cosine similarity classification with confidence filtering

### Improved Approach
After analyzing initial results (mAP@50 = 1.9%), we implemented key improvements:
1. Replace NWPU-trained RPN with COCO pre-trained RPN for better proposals
2. Enhanced prototype finetuning with data augmentation
3. Optimized hyperparameters and training procedures
4. Comprehensive evaluation framework with COCO metrics

**Result**: Achieved 2x performance improvement (mAP@50 = 3.7%)

## Dataset: NWPU VHR-10

- **10 classes**: airplane, ship, storage-tank, baseball-diamond, tennis-court, basketball-court, ground-track-field, harbor, bridge, vehicle
- **Base Classes** (7): ship, storage-tank, basketball-court, ground-track-field, harbor, bridge, vehicle
- **Novel Classes** (3): airplane, baseball-diamond, tennis-court
- **Few-Shot Setting**: 20-shot per novel class

## Architecture

### Stage 1: Base Model Training (Initial)
- **Model**: Faster R-CNN with ResNet-50 FPN backbone
- **Training**: On 7 base classes from NWPU VHR-10
- **Output**: Domain-specific RPN for aerial imagery

### Stage 2: Prototype Finetuning
- **RPN**: Initially used NWPU-trained, later improved with COCO pre-trained
- **Feature Extractor**: DINOv2 ViT-L/14 (frozen, 1024-dim features)
- **Learning**: Fine-tune prototype vectors using 20-shot examples
- **Method**: Cosine similarity + cross-entropy loss with temperature scaling

### Stage 3: Inference
- **Proposal Generation**: COCO pre-trained RPN (improved approach)
- **Feature Extraction**: DINOv2 for each proposal
- **Classification**: Cosine similarity with tuned prototypes
- **Post-processing**: NMS and confidence filtering

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
```bash
pip install torch torchvision pillow numpy scikit-learn pycocotools tqdm
```

### Download Required Data and Models

- Download and extract to `data/` directory
- Contains training and test images with annotations

**ü§ñ Pre-trained Models**: [Saved Models](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1JQJdqdIXPlRL6edcYNxmvKiIcIN3VcO6?usp=sharing)  
- Download and extract to `saved_models/` directory
- Includes base model and fine-tuned prototypes

### Setup Instructions
```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd FSOD_Aerial_Demo

# 2. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. Download data and models from Google Drive links above
# Extract data to: data/NWPU VHR-10/
# Extract models to: saved_models/

# 4. Verify directory structure matches the Project Structure below
```

### Run Complete Pipeline
```bash
# Step 1: Train base model (optional - can skip to use COCO pre-trained)
python src/train/base_model_training.py

# Step 2: Fine-tune prototypes with improved COCO RPN
python src/train/improved_coco_rpn_finetuning.py

# Step 3: Run demo and evaluation
python src/predict/demo_inference.py
```

This will generate:
- Detection visualizations in `results_improved/`
- Comprehensive evaluation metrics
- Performance comparison with baseline
